    <img src="src/fasworld.png" alt="fasworld" height="50px" width="50px"></p>
    <p>FasPay is an international money transfer operator that will help individuals, small business owners, and online sellers make international transfers without limitations and difficulties.</p>
    <p>FasPay was founded by Faruk Abubakar Sadiq and it was founded because of the lack of access to some services offered by some of the international money transfer operators like virtual accounts or country ineligiblity. And other problems like higher transfer costs and foreign exchange (FX) charges, all leading to frustration, disappointment and inefficiency to customers, small business owners, and online sellers.</p>
    <p>There are many stories to tell about FasPay. FasPay was started as a challenge at ALX Founders Academy...</p>
