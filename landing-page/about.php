    <p>FasPay is an international money transfer operator that will help individuals, small business owners, and online sellers make international transfers without limitations and difficulties.</p>
    <p>FasPay was founded by Faruk Abubakar Sadiq and it was founded because of the lack of access to some services offered by some of the international money transfer operators like virtual accounts or country ineligiblity. And other problems like higher transfer costs and foreign exchange (FX) charges, all leading to frustration, disappointment and inefficiency to customers, small business owners, and online sellers.</p>
    <p>There are many stories to tell about FasPay. FasPay was started as a challenge at ALX Founders Academy namely #DoHardThingsChallenge so at ALX Founders Academy you're supposed to come up with a great startup business idea in order to succeed. However, I didn't intend to apply before but after 2 days of getting the challenge email I then remembered something that frustrated me about virtual accounts and international transfer. Then I talked to myself and said "Why not try to create an international money transfer app that will conquer all those difficulties?" So that's what motivated me to start FasPay.</p>
    <p>Consequently, I also used my FasPay idea as my portfolio project in my ongoing Software Engineering Program at ALX and that's where I completed my FasPay Landing Page that will be collecting users' interest about the app to become a beta user. Using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. In short, I used MAP framework. However, I already finished my business plan using lean canvas model, prototype using canvas, pitch deck, and pitch video before graduating from ALX Founders Academy. We're currently in incubation period at Founders Academy.</p>
